# PolySlice
Code to generate graphics of a polygon subdivision process.

This is a few python scripts for cutting a polygon into sections of equal area,
with the restriction that each cut has to start where the last one ends.

Run `plot.py` to generate the full set of images and animated GIFs. If you only
want some of them, or want to generate them with different parameters than
default, you will need to modify the script to suit your needs.
